# Invoicer-API
The backend to support the UI for the invoicer project

## Getting started
We use docker to manage the local environment, run `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up` and you should be up and running. Of course, make sure you are logged into the registry with `docker login`.

Once docker is done spinning up you should be able to access the project in your browser at 0.0.0.0:5000/127.0.0.1:5000 depending on your OS, and be greeted with a friendly message.
